			<p>	Python is hot primarily because it has all the right stuﬀ for the kind of software 			development that’s really driving the whole software development world
				these days. Machine learning, robotics, artifcial intelligence, and data science are
				the leading technologies today and for the foreseeable future. Python is popular
				mainly because it already has lots of capabilities in those areas, while many older
				languages lag behind in these technologies.
			</p>
			<p> If you’re not familiar with programming languages like C and Java, feel free to
				skip to the next section, as this information is only for people
				who wonder about diﬀerences among the languages. But in case you’re wondering, just as there are diﬀerent brands of toothpaste, shampoo, cars, and just about
				every other product you can buy, there are diﬀerent “brands” of programming
				languages with names like Java, C, C++ (pronounced C plus plus), and C# (pronounced
				C sharp). They’re all programming languages, just like all brands of toothpaste are
				toothpaste. The main reasons cited for Python’s current popularity are:					
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python is relatively easy to learn</li>
				<li>Everything you need to learn (and do) Python is free.</li>
				<li>Python oﬀers more readymade tools for current hot technologies like data
					science, machine learning, artifcial intelligence, and robotics than most other
					languages.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<header>Data Types</header>
			<p> You deal with written information all the time and probably don’t think about
				the diﬀerence between numbers and text (that is, letters and words). But there’s
				a big diﬀerence between numbers and text in a computer because with numbers, you can do arithmetic (add, subtract, multiple, divide). For example, everybody
				knows that 1+1 = 2. The same doesn’t apply to letters and words. The expression
				A+A doesn’t necessary equal B or AA or anything else because unlike numbers,
				letters and words aren’t quantities.		
			</p>
			
			<section id="Numbers" class="sub-section">
				<header>Numbers</header>
				<p> 
					Numbers in Python must start with a number digit, (0-9); a dot (period), which
					is a decimal point; or a hyphen (-) used as a negative sign for negative numbers.
					A number can contain only one decimal point. It should contain no letters, spaces,
					dollar signs, or anything else that isn’t part of a normal number.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Integers" class="sub-section">
				<header>Integers</header>
				<p> 
					An integer is any whole number, positive or negative. There is no limit to its size.
					Numbers like 0, -1, and 999999999999999 are all perfectly valid integers. From
					your perspective, an integer is just any valid number that doesn’t contain a decimal point.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Floats" class="sub-section">
				<header>Floats</header>
				<p> 
					A ﬂoating point number, often called a ﬂoat for short, is just any valid number that contains a decimal point. Again, there is no size limit, 1.1 and -1.1 and
					123456.789012345 are all perfectly valid ﬂoats.
				</p>
				<P> 
					If you happen to work with very large scientifc numbers, you can put an e in a
					number to indicate the power of 10. For example, 234e1000 is a valid number, and
					will be treated as a ﬂoat even if there’s no decimal point. If you’re familiar with
					scientifc notation, you know 234e3 is 234,000 (replace the e3 with 3 zeroes). If
					you’re not familiar with scientifc notation, don’t worry about it. If you’re not
					using it in your day-to-day work now, chances are you’ll never need it in Python
					either.
				</P>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Complex_Numbers" class="sub-section">
				<header>Complex Numbers</header>
				<p>
					Just about any kind of number can be expressed as an integer or ﬂoat, so being
					familiar with those is sufcient for just about everyone. Though in the interest
					of being accurate we should point out that Python also supports complex numbers.
					These bizarre little charmers always end with the letter j, which is the imaginary
					part of the number. If you have absolutely no idea what we’re talking about, then
					you’re a normal person because only people who are really “out there” in math
					land care about these. If you’ve never heard of them before now, chances are you
					won’t be using them in your computer work or Python programming
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Strings" class="sub-section">
				<header>Strings</header>
				<p>
					Strings are sort of the opposite of numbers. Names, addresses, and all other kinds of text you see every day would be a string in Python (and for computers in general). It’s called a string because it’s a string of characters (letters, spaces, punctuation marks,maybe some numbers). Unlike numbers, a string must always be enclosed in quotation marks. You can use either double quotation marks (“) or singles (‘). All the following are valid strings:
					<code>
					"Hi there, I am a string"
					\n'Hello world'
					"123 Oak Tree Lane"
					"(267)555-1234"
					"18901-3384"
					</code>
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Booleans" class="sub-section">
				<header>Booleans</header>
				<p>
					it can be one of two values: either True or False. In Python code, people store True or False values in variables using a format similar to this: 
					<code>
						x = True
					</code>
					<code>
						X = False
					</code>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You know True and False are Boolean here because they’re not enclosed in quotation marks (as a string would be), and they’re not numbers. Also, the initial cap is
					required. In other words, the frst letter has to be capitalized and all the remaining
					letters after that have to be lowercase.
				</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
			<header>Variables</header>
			<p>
				Variables are a big part of Python and all computer programming languages.
				A variable is simply a placeholder for information that may vary (change). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Python variable names have to conform to certain rules to be recognized as variable names. The rules are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_).</li>
				<li>After the frst letter you can use letters, numbers, or underscores.</li> 
				<li>Variable names are case-sensitive, so once you make up a name, any other
					reference to that variable must use the same uppercase and lowercase letters
					as the name you originally made up.
				</li> 
				<li>Variable names cannot be enclosed in, or contain, single or double quotation
					marks.
				</li>
				<li>PEP 8 style conventions recommend using only lowercase letters in variable
					names, use an underscore to separate multiple words in the variable name.
				</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>
				To create a variable, you use the syntax (order of things) as follows:
				<code>variablename = value</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>x = 10</code>
				. . . we are storing the number 10 in a variable named x. Or, in other words, we’re
				assigning the value 10 to the variable named x.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here . . .
				<code>user_name = "Alan"</code>
				We’re putting the string Alan in a variable named username.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="main-section" id="Comments">
			<header>Comments</header>
			<P>
				A programmer’s comment (usually called a comment for short) is text in the program that
				does nothing. Because a comment isn’t code, your wording can be anything you want. However, to be identifed as a comment, the text must:
			</P>
			<ul>
				<li>Start with a pound sign</li>
				<li>Or be enclosed in triple quotation marks</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If it’s a short comment (if it doesn’t extend to two or more lines), the leading
				pound sign is sufcient. Often you’ll see that pound sign followed by a space, as
				in the example below, but that space is optional:
			</p>
			<code><!-- short-code for #-->This is a Python comment</code>
			<p>
				Larger comments are sometimes called docstrings. Here’s an example of what one may look like in Python code:
			<code>
				<!-- include 3 double quotes -->This is a multiline comment in Python
				This type of comment is sometimes called a docstring.
				A docstring starts with three double-quotation marks (""") and also ends with
				three double quotation marks
			</code>
